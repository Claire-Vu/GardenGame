Some things to fix:
Claire-
  Fixes:
    - fixed bug where getObject does not return the same object (this led to the problem

      of crops not getting their TimesPlanted days reset to 0 and meant that any new crop was
      already fully grown)

  Improvements Made:
    -Made store run until the player exits using E 

    -Cleaned up interface a bit more by clearing console after users login/signup

    -feature- Crops not harvested within 5 days of becoming fully grown become spoiled and
    can no longer be harvested (players can only remove them)

Yen-
  Improvements:
    -in AskWhatToPlant()- "Available crops: carrot, potato, etc" (change to what is in the user's inventory)
  
  Bugs:
    -When the user enters an invalid input in AskWhereToPlant(), the function returns row 0 0 which
    causes the crop to be planted

    -AskWhereToPlant() doesn't check user input type

Elaine-

  Improvements:
  - Displaying error messages

  - Would be nice if printed what was in the user's inventory so they didn't have to guess
    how many seeds they have and so on

  Bugs:
  - Found bug*
      Description: Runtime error when entering random values for buy (does not occur with sell)
      To recreate the bug- 
        - 4 (to go to shop)
        -"buy"
        -"d"
        -"d"
